# 👋 Welcome to My Data Science Portfolio

Hi, I'm **Sandra**!

This repository showcases selected data science and machine learning projects developed during my MSc in Data Science and personal work. My focus is on building **end-to-end ML pipelines** with production-ready practices, including model training, evaluation, deployment, and orchestration.

Each project demonstrates different aspects of the ML lifecycle. Feel free to explore!

### 2. Microsoft Malware Prediction
A **binary classification project** to predict whether a Windows machine will be infected by malware based on telemetry data from Windows Defender.

This project tackles a **large-scale dataset** (8.9M rows) from a Kaggle competition, applying a complete supervised learning workflow:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Handling class imbalance
- Model selection and hyperparameter tuning
- Performance evaluation with appropriate metrics
- Model interpretation

The project was developed as part of my **Master's degree in Data Science** and demonstrates:
- Proper ML methodology (EDA-first approach)
- Efficient code practices (functions, list comprehensions)
- Comprehensive model evaluation beyond standard metrics

**Tech Stack:** Python · Pandas · NumPy · Scikit-learn · Matplotlib/Seaborn

> **Dataset:** [Microsoft Malware Prediction - Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/microsoft-malware-prediction)
