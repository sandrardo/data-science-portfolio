# Welcome to My Data Science Portfolio 👋

Hi, I'm Sandra!  

This repository contains selected data science and machine learning projects
developed during my MSc and personal work, with a strong focus on
end-to-end pipelines, model training, evaluation and deployment practices.

Each project can be explored individually. Below is a brief overview:

## 📊 Projects

### 1. Customer Churn Prediction (End-to-End ML Pipeline)
An end-to-end machine learning pipeline to predict customer churn, including:
- Data preprocessing
- Model training and evaluation
- Model explainability
- Experiment tracking
- Orchestration with Airflow
- Containerization with Docker

*(More projects will be added soon)*

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
Python · Pandas · Scikit-learn · Docker · Airflow · MLflow · SQL


### 2. Exploratory Analysis of Railway Ticket Prices

This project focuses on an **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** of railway journeys and ticket prices.

The main objective is to **understand the data before applying any predictive modeling**, by exploring price distributions, detecting anomalies, identifying patterns across routes and cities, and validating assumptions through careful analysis and visualization.

The work emphasizes:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis
- Identification of common pitfalls in data analysis
- Meaningful and well-designed visualizations to communicate insights

The project was developed as part of a **Master’s degree in Data Science** and received top evaluation for analytical depth, code structure, clarity of reasoning, and data visualizations.

### Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Plotly for data visualization

> **Note:** The dataset used in this project is provided for educational purposes and may not reflect real-world railway ticket prices.

Feel free to explore the projects or contact me via LinkedIn.
