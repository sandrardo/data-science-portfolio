# Malware Infection Prediction

## Project Overview
This project focuses on building a supervised machine learning model to predict the probability of malware infection on Windows machines. The dataset comes from the Kaggle *Microsoft Malware Prediction* competition, where each record represents a unique device and the target variable indicates whether malware was detected.

The goal of the project is to implement a complete and well-structured supervised learning workflow, from data understanding to model evaluation and interpretation.

## Problem Statement
Given telemetry data collected from Windows machines, the objective is to predict whether a device is infected by malware. This is framed as a binary classification problem, where accurate predictions can help improve security monitoring and risk assessment.

## Dataset
- **Source:** Kaggle – Microsoft Malware Prediction
- **Observations:** Each row corresponds to a unique machine
- **Target variable:** `HasDetections` (binary)
- **Features:** Hardware, software, and system configuration attributes

Due to the size and complexity of the dataset, particular attention is paid to missing values, high-cardinality features, and data preprocessing strategies.

## Methodology
The project follows a standard supervised machine learning pipeline:

1. **Data Understanding & Exploratory Data Analysis**
   - Initial data inspection and descriptive analysis
   - Identification of missing values and data quality issues
   - Exploratory visualizations to understand feature distributions

2. **Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering**
   - Handling of missing values
   - Encoding of categorical variables
   - Feature selection and transformation

3. **Modeling**
   - Training and comparison of supervised classification models
   - Hyperparameter tuning where appropriate

4. **Evaluation**
   - Model evaluation using suitable classification metrics
   - Validation strategy to assess generalization performance

5. **Model Interpretation**
   - Analysis of feature importance
   - Interpretation of model behavior beyond raw performance metrics
