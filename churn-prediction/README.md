# Churn Prediction – End-to-End Machine Learning Pipeline

This project implements an end-to-end machine learning pipeline to predict customer churn.
It covers the full lifecycle of a data science project, from data preprocessing and feature
engineering to model training, evaluation and explainability.

The pipeline is orchestrated using Apache Airflow and runs in a Dockerized environment,
with experiment tracking managed through MLflow.
