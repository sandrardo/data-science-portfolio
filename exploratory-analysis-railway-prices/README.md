# Railway Ticket Prices – EDA Project

This repository contains an **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** project focused on railway journeys and ticket prices.

The analysis explores pricing behavior across routes and cities, aiming to better understand the structure, quality and limitations of the dataset through systematic exploration and visualization.

## Analysis overview
The notebook covers the following steps:
- Initial data inspection and quality checks
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploration of price distributions
- Route- and city-level comparisons
- Identification of anomalies and unusual values
- Correlation analysis with careful variable selection
- Visualization of insights using interactive plots

## Key focus
- Understanding the data before modeling
- Asking relevant analytical questions
- Avoiding misleading statistical interpretations
- Using visualization as an explanatory tool, not decoration

## Tools used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Plotly

## Notes
- The dataset was provided for educational purposes and may not represent real-world ticket prices.
- Code comments within the notebook are written in Spanish.
